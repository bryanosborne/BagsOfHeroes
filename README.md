# BagsOfHeroes

Identify 8-10 comic book super heroes from at least 3 different publishers, i.e., DC, Marvel, etc.

Create a LinkedBag of heroes for each of the publishers and load the heroes' names (a single String) into the appropriate bag.

Write code to allow a user to provide the name of a hero and provide the name of the publisher who owns the character.

When the user correctly specifies a hero, remove the hero from the respective bag.

Allow the user to keep guessing until they have emptied one of the publisher bags and provide a congratulatory message on their knowledge of that publisherâ€™s heroes.
